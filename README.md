# BEMsass

BEMsass is a responsive CSS framework built in SASS and using the BEM naming format.  This includes the best practices and important UI components that I use in all of my front-end developments.

This project is intended to be a starting point for the look and feel of front-end projects.  You will need to add your specific project requirements and logic that you require.


## Features

- Written in BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention. This provides consistent and easy to extend library.
- Uses 7-1 project structure for scalable and maintainable SASS.
- Uses node-sass, concat, post-css, and compress-css to produce this baseline CSS.  Feel free to use my npm scripts in your project flow. Remember to change the input and output directories/filenames.
- Includes CSS Grid and Flexbox methods to make it friendly in most application developments.
